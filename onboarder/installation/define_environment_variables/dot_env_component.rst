Using the DotEnv file
=====================

The `Dotenv Symfony component <https://github.com/symfony/dotenv>`_ is a dependency already available
into the PIM as it's a standard Symfony framework component. It is also used by default in the PIM starting Akeneo PIM
``4.0``.

Edit the ``.env`` file at your project root directory and add the environment variables values provided on your
Onboarder project page on the Partner Portal.
