How to update a minor version or to apply a patch?
==================================================

We frequently release patches for all supported versions. Each patch contains bug fixes and sometimes improvements or
security fixes, **that is why it is very important to always have the latest Onboarder patch installed on your PIM.**

New minor versions bring new features.
