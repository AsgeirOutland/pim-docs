Migrate Akeneo Onboarder projects
=================================

This chapter describes how to apply a patch on your current version or how to upgrade from a minor/major version to a more recent one.

New minor versions bring new features to answer clients growing needs. Each release is provided with a migration guide
and a set of scripts to automate it as much as possible. We continue to improve this process to make every new migration
easier than the previous one.

As a prerequisite, we assume that you are using a project installed from a PIM Enterprise Standard edition (:doc:`/onboarder/installation/index`).
It is especially important that you added the Onboarder Composer upgrade script to your PIM ``composer.json``.
