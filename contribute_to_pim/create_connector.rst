How to contribute to a Connector?
=================================

We're happy to connect the PIM to any third-party system!

* Begin by checking on the forum that nobody is writing the same connector: https://marketplace.akeneo.com/
* Create your connector :doc:`/import_and_export_data/guides/create-connector`
* Reference it on `Akeneo Marketplace <https://marketplace.akeneo.com/>`_
