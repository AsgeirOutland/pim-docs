PHP7 and HHVM Compatibility?
============================

PHP7
----

We continued our effort regarding Akeneo PIM PHP7 support.

We're happy to announce that PHP7 is now supported and production ready for both CLI and Web.

This modification introduces a new constraint, the minimum version of PHP for Akeneo PIM 2.x is now PHP 7.1.

HHVM
----

Will not be supported.
