Server side set up for hosting
==============================

Hardware
--------

The required configuration depends on your volume and your usage. As we are based on Elasticsearch and MySQL, please check their dedicated documentation to define your server size.

.. warning::

  Should you use VCPu, keep in mind that VCPus do not provide same level of performance as real CPUs. Amazon servers, for instance, offer only 10 to 25% of performances of a real CPU.
